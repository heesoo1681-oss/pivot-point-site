Section: The problem (3 bullets)

Declining mental health among teens and young adults is rising alongside isolation.

In a new environment like college, almost 100% of freshmen feel lost and lonely at some point during freshman year.

Many sophomores through seniors feel this too.

Section: Mission
Our mission is to spread awareness of the mental health decline in college students—starting at UT—and prevent excessive mental and physical isolation that can lead to depression, anxiety, and harmful downstream effects.

Section: Goal
Our goal is to make UT a community where you can find your identity through reflection, reconnect with your “why,” and invest in your well-being—not put all your eggs in one basket (academics, internships/career, one relationship, or one friend group).

Section: What we do (3 cards)

Psychology insights: studies + practical takeaways

Student stories: real experiences, honest reflection

Skill mini-workshops: time management, stress control, social confidence, etc.

Mission (/about)

Title: Our Mission & Why We Exist

Copy (short, readable):
We believe the trend of declining mental health in teens and young adults has a strong correlation with mental and physical isolation.
College can intensify this—especially at the start of freshman year, but it can persist throughout sophomore to senior year as well.

Mission statement:
We aim to spread awareness across the UT campus and reduce the isolation that can contribute to depression, anxiety, and other harmful outcomes.

Goal statement:
We want UT to be a place where you can find your identity through reflection, reconnect with your “why,” and stay balanced—academics and career matter, but your well-being matters too.
